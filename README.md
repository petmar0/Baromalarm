The Baromalarm is a simple device that is based on the idea that people with chronic pain often experience the most pain when a weather front moves through. Since fronts don't create an instantaneous pressure differential, it's possible to look at the rate of change of pressure (dP/dt) and determine when it begins to change enough to soon cause an increase in pain. Thus, if a chronic pain sufferer knows when a front might begin to come through, they might be able to take some sort of pain medication at a time where it will be effective in time for the actual arrival of the weather front.

The device is made up of several components:
* Arduino Pro Mini
* BMP180 Pressure Sensor Breakout Board
* Buzzer
* TM1637 4-digit Display Board
* AA Holder
* DC-DC Boost Converter
